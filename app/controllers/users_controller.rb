# the params hash contains information about each request.
# in the case of a URI like /users/1, the value of params[:id] is 
# the id of the corresponding user (1 in this example). 
#
# In the case of posting to the signup form, params instead contains a 
# hash of hashes. 
#
# Although the hash keys appear as strings in the debug output, 
# internally Rails uses symbols, so that params[:user] is the hash of 
# user attributesâ€”in fact, exactly the attributes needed as 
# an argument to User.new. 
#
# This means that the line @user = User.new(params[:user])
# Is equivalent to
# @user = User.new(name: "Foo Bar", email: "foo@invalid",
#                  password: "dude", password_confirmation: "dude")

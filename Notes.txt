PROBLEMS

- Alt text not appearing when no image file present 
	** Solved - this is a chrome thing
- Growl sometimes not working with rspec, guard, spork
	** Solved - checked all gems correct. Checked Growl manually in irb. 
- mate not working outside home directory
	** Not solved - switched to Sublime Text 2

NEED TO DO / NOTES

- See section 7.4.4 for heroku deployment (incl SSL).. then section 8?
- look up SecureRandom - can't find this?
- Look up flash. (the arg seems to be a css styl tag? )
- look up cookies
- lookup before_save callback
- check out the header info in gitignore
- http://api.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.0/classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_science)
- read about Rails API save - noting the validate: false option... http://api.rubyonrails.org/v3.2.0/classes/ActiveRecord/Persistence.html#method-i-save
- Have a look at the paperclip gem, for image uploads and custom image handling (chapter 7 footnotes 8)
- Install and use PostgreSQL? Does it have a good db browser??
- Look at Markdown syntax
- Read more about Capybara, Guard, Spork, RSpec
- Lookup image_tag  - part of what?
	** part of ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper
- Lookup render method - which class does this belong to
	** It's complicated! entry point in Actionview::Renderer.render, then used by AV and AC
- Lookup content_tag method - used in application.html.erb
	** part of ActionView::Helpers::TagHelper

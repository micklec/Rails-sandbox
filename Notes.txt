Notes / problems

- Alt text not appearing when no image file present 
	** Solved - this is a chrome thing
- Growl sometimes not working with rspec, guard, spork
	** Solved - checked all gems correct. Checked Growl manually in irb. 
- mate not working outside home directory
	** Not solved - switched to Sublime Text 2!!
